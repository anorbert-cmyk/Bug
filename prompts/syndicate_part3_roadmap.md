## PART 3 OUTPUT STRUCTURE

### 1. Strategic Approach Selection

Based on discovery and competitive analysis, recommend:

**Primary Methodology:**
- Selected approach (e.g., Lean UX, Design Sprint, Jobs-to-be-Done, Service Design)
- Why this approach fits this specific problem
- Expected timeline impact
- Resource requirements

**"Behind the Decision" Rationale:**
- What alternatives were considered
- Why they were rejected
- How this balances speed vs rigor

### 2. Phase-by-Phase Roadmap

Structure based on complexity level from Part 1:
- Quick Win: Week-by-week (4-6 weeks)
- Medium: Month-by-month (3-4 months)
- Strategic: Quarter-by-quarter (6-12 months)

#### Phase 1: [Name] (Timeline)

**Objectives:**
- Primary goal
- Secondary goals

**Key Deliverables:**
1. Deliverable with acceptance criteria
2. [etc.]

**Critical Decision Points:**
- Decision needed, stakeholders involved, deadline

**Dependencies:**
- What must be complete before this phase
- External dependencies (APIs, partnerships, etc.)

**Team Collaboration Touchpoints:**
- Who syncs with whom, when, format

**Risk Factors:**
- Specific risk + mitigation strategy

#### Phase 2-N: [Repeat structure]

### 3. Error Path Mapping (CRITICAL SECTION)

Identify top 7 failure scenarios users might encounter:

#### Failure Scenario [N]: [Name]

**What Goes Wrong:**
Description from user's perspective

**User Impact:**
- Emotional response
- Abandonment risk (High/Medium/Low)
- Business impact

**Recovery UX Pattern:**
- Specific microcopy (real text, not placeholder)
- Visual treatment recommendation
- Interaction design (what happens on click/tap)

**Instrumentation Needs:**
- What to log/track to detect this failure
- Alert thresholds

**Priority:** High/Medium/Low (based on likelihood × severity)

### 4. Team Collaboration Model

**Recommended Team Composition:**
| Role | Responsibility | Time Allocation |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| UX Lead | [specific] | [X hrs/week] |
| Researcher | [specific] | [X hrs/week] |
| Visual Designer | [specific] | [X hrs/week] |
| PM | [specific] | [X hrs/week] |
| Engineering Lead | [specific] | [X hrs/week] |
| QA | [specific] | [X hrs/week] |

**For Solo Founders:**
Modified approach with:
- Self-paced checkpoints
- AI tool acceleration (specific tools)
- Async documentation practices

**Key Collaboration Moments:**
- Kick-off: Format, attendees, agenda
- Mid-point Review: Format, decision authority
- Pre-launch: Checklist, sign-off process

**Documentation Standards:**
- Design handoff: Figma Dev Mode specs
- Decision logs: Miro/FigJam
- Documentation: Notion/Confluence structure

### 5. Milestone Summary Table

| Milestone | Target Date | Owner | Success Criteria | Dependencies |
|-----------|-------------|-------|------------------|--------------|
| M1 | Week X | Role | Measurable outcome | None |
| M2 | Week Y | Role | Measurable outcome | M1 |
| [etc.] | | | | |

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES

**Balance is Mandatory:** Every recommendation must balance user needs and business goals. Make tradeoffs explicit.

**Business Risk Flagging:** If any direction risks revenue, compliance, or scalability, flag with ⚠️ BUSINESS RISK and propose alternative.

**User Friction Flagging:** If any constraint limits usability, flag with ⚠️ USER FRICTION and suggest compromise.
